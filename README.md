# BruControl
BruControl Scripts and Python Data-Excahnge code for BruControl integration. All code in this repo is licensed under MIT. 

### Data Exchange
Python scripts deisgned to run on the same host as BruControl supporting integration with BrewFather. BruDevice demonstrates how to get global values from BruControl and send them to BrewFather via its Rest API. BruGlue shows how to pull recipe data from BrewFather and update BruControl values accordingly for integration on brew day. 

### Sensors
Arduino sketches deisnged to run on separate (non-BruControl) Arduino processors providing integration between BruControl and Atlas Scientific pH and Dissolved O2 meters with the matching EZO circuit boards.
